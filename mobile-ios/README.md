* Tools:

* [`SwiftGen`](https://github.com/SwiftGen/SwiftGen) - SwiftGen is a tool to automatically generate Swift code for resources of your projects (like images, localised strings, etc), to make them type-safe to use.
* [`SwiftLint`](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions, loosely based on the now archived GitHub Swift Style Guide. SwiftLint enforces the style guide rules that are generally accepted by the Swift community.
